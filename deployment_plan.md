# Deployment and Validation Plan

This document outlines the revised implementation plan and validation strategy for the bug fixes in `entrypoint.sh` and related scripts.

## 1. Revised Implementation Plan

This is an ordered checklist of commands to apply the fixes, clean up the environment, and restart the service.

1.  **Set File Permissions:**
    *   Ensure all shell scripts are executable.
    ```bash
    chmod +x entrypoint.sh scripts/*.sh
    ```

2.  **Cleanup Stale Environment:**
    *   Remove any artifacts from previous failed deployments and clean up the Docker environment to ensure a fresh start.
    ```bash
    # Optional: Remove any known temporary/log files from failed runs (example)
    # rm -f /tmp/failed_deployment.log

    # Prune unused Docker resources to prevent conflicts
    docker system prune -af
    ```

3.  **Rebuild and Restart Container:**
    *   Take down the existing container, rebuild the image without using cache to ensure all changes are applied, and start the new container in detached mode.
    ```bash
    docker-compose down && docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up -d
    ```

## 2. Validation Strategy

This strategy provides a step-by-step process to validate each component in isolation before verifying the full system.

1.  **File Organization (`organizer.sh`):**
    *   **Objective:** Test that the script correctly organizes files.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  Create a sample file to be organized.
            ```bash
            touch sample_document.txt
            ```
        2.  Execute the organizer script manually.
            ```bash
            ./scripts/organizer.sh
            ```
        3.  **Verification:** Check if `sample_document.txt` has been moved to the expected directory (e.g., `organized/`).
            ```bash
            ls organized/sample_document.txt
            ```
        *   **Expected Result:** The command should list the file without errors.

2.  **Integrity Check (`enhanced_integrity_check.sh`):**
    *   **Objective:** Verify that the integrity check script runs successfully and reports a pass status.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  Run the script directly.
            ```bash
            ./scripts/enhanced_integrity_check.sh
            ```
    *   **Verification:** Examine the output for a success message.
    *   **Expected Result:** The script's output should contain a line similar to `System integrity check passed.`

3.  **Diagnosis (`diagnosis.sh`):**
    *   **Objective:** Ensure the diagnosis script can be triggered and provides meaningful output.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  Execute the diagnosis script.
            ```bash
            ./scripts/diagnosis.sh
            ```
    *   **Verification:** Review the output for diagnostic information, such as service status, disk space, or container health.
    *   **Expected Result:** The script should output a summary of the system's state without any errors.

4.  **Full System Verification:**
    *   **Objective:** Confirm the entire system is operational after the container starts.
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  After running `docker-compose up -d`, monitor the container logs.
            ```bash
            docker-compose logs -f
            ```
    *   **Verification:** Look for the final confirmation message from the `entrypoint.sh` script.
    *   **Expected Result:** The logs should display the message: `System is operational.`
