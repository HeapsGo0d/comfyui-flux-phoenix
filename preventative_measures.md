# Preventative Measures for Deployment Failures

To prevent future deployment failures related to shell scripts, we recommend implementing the following best practices.

## 1. Pre-Commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks automatically run checks on your code before it is committed, catching potential issues early.

### Recommended Tool: `pre-commit`

The `pre-commit` framework is a powerful tool for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks.

### Implementation Steps:

1.  **Install `pre-commit`:**
    ```bash
    pip install pre-commit
    ```

2.  **Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file** in the root of your repository with the following content:
    ```yaml
    repos:
    -   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
        rev: v4.0.1
        hooks:
        -   id: check-yaml
        -   id: end-of-file-fixer
        -   id: trailing-whitespace
    -   repo: https://github.com/shellcheck-py/shellcheck-py
        rev: v0.7.2.1
        hooks:
        -   id: shellcheck
    ```

3.  **Install the git hook scripts:**
    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

Now, every time you run `git commit`, `shellcheck` will automatically run on your shell scripts.

## 2. Automated Linting and Testing

Integrating automated checks into your CI/CD pipeline ensures that no problematic code gets deployed.

### Strategy:

*   **Linting:** Use `shellcheck` to perform static analysis on all shell scripts during the build process. This will catch common syntax errors, semantic problems, and style issues.
*   **Testing:** Implement a testing framework like `bats-core` to run unit tests on your shell scripts. This is a more advanced step but provides a higher level of confidence.

### Example: Using `shellcheck` in a CI/CD Pipeline

Here is an example of how you might use `shellcheck` in a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Run ShellCheck
      run: |
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y shellcheck
        shellcheck scripts/*.sh
```

This will fail the build if any errors are found in the shell scripts located in the `scripts/` directory.

## 3. Improved Logging

Structured logging makes it significantly easier to debug issues in production.

### Best Practices:

*   **Use a Consistent Format:** Adopt a consistent, machine-readable log format like JSON.
*   **Include Context:** Each log entry should include important contextual information like a timestamp, log level, script name, and a descriptive message.
*   **Log Levels:** Use different log levels (e.g., `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`) to indicate the severity of the message.

### Suggested Log Format:

Here is a sample logging function and its output:

**Function:**
```bash
log() {
  local level="$1"
  local message="$2"
  echo "{\"timestamp\": \"$(date -u --iso-8601=seconds)\", \"level\": \"$level\", \"script\": \"$(basename "$0")\", \"message\": \"$message\"}"
}

# Example usage
log "INFO" "Starting the service..."
log "ERROR" "Failed to connect to the database."
```

**Output:**
```json
{"timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z", "level": "INFO", "script": "service_manager.sh", "message": "Starting the service..."}
{"timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:00:05Z", "level": "ERROR", "script": "service_manager.sh", "message": "Failed to connect to the database."}
